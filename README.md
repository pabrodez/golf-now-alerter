Once you've [created a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and got your token, you'll need a chat id.
Go to `https://api.telegram.org/bot(yourToken)/getUpdates`, send a message to your bot from your account, refresh the previous link and check for the id in
`result.message.chat.id`. Copy and paste it in the `.env` file as below.

Download:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pabrodez/golf-now-alerter
cd golf-now-alerter
npm install
``` 
Create a `.env` file in the root folder:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your telegram bot token goes here
CHAT_ID=the chat id to send alerts to
```
Tweak the `data.ts` file:
```javascript
vars = {
    days: 1,  // frequency in days
    hourDay: 10,  // hour of the day to start processing the alert
    minuteDay: 0,  // minute of the day to start processing the alert
    daysOut: 14,  // how many days from now
    preferredDaysWeek: [6, 0], // 0 = sunday, 1 = monday, etc
    golfNowUrl: 'https://www.golfnow.co.uk',

}
```

```bash
npm run-script build
npm run-script start
```
